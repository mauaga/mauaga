- 👋 Hi, I’m @mauaga
- 👀 I’m interested in tech, programming, retrocomputing, Linux, Open Source, a little in Raspberry PI, retrogaming. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how modernize Mainframe lecagy solutiuon, digitalization proccess, Python, GIT and Kubernetes
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... nothing at the moment, I not have any ability to programming o do something interesting by now, I'm still learning...

This is my first account on GITHUB, making it in order to learn GIT and his crazy world.
